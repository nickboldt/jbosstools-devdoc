#  Building locally via commandline

First, fetch the sources of the project you want to build from Github. For details, see link:configuring_git_workflow.adoc#Sources[Configuring Git Workflow - Sources].

Then, switch into the directory where you checked out the sources, and run this:


[source,bash]
----
cd ~/my-github-stuff/jbosstools-base

# build everything and run all tests
mvn clean install -fae -e
 
# or, if you don't want to install built artifacts into your ~/.m2 repo,
mvn clean verify -fae -e

# or, if you only want to build your tests, but not run them,
mvn clean verify -fae -e -DskipTests

# or, if you want to build your tests, but only run the unit tests, not integration tests
mvn clean verify -fae -e -DskipITests
