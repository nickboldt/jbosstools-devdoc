= Jira filters for JBoss Tools and Developer Studio

Before January 2014 various groups/people created their own filters or jira queries to track what was currently being worked on.
That unforunately often lead to time wasted because either filters were not visible or queries were not defined the same way and
issues were missed.

To attempt reduce the confusion we now have a https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/jbosstools-jiralint-daily/[job (require vpn)] 
running that generates filters based on filters defined in https://github.com/maxandersen/jiralint/blob/master/filters.json[filters.json] and https://github.com/maxandersen/jiralint/blob/master/filters-composite.json[filters-composite.json]
using a list of versions defined by a bit of regular expression magic at https://github.com/maxandersen/jiralint/blob/master/constants.json[constants.json].

These filter give a stable URL, will always track the latest 'maintanence', 'master', 'frozen' and what is 'next' without having
to manually update jira queries every few weeks.

The full list is listed below but in general the intent is not to just link to the specific filter url, but use the filters in a JQL query you then share.
i.e. https://issues.jboss.org/issues/?jql=filter%3Dds_freeze%20and%20filter%3Dds_unresolved["filter=ds_freeze and filter=ds_unresolved"] to find what issues are still unresolved in the frozen versions.
